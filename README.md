This project is a mini application built with Spring Boot.  
The main problem it addresses is managing data efficiently with proper CRUD operations and a structured approach.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Building web applications often requires:
- A way to handle user requests and responses.
- Managing data persistence in a database.
- Providing clear APIs or views for interaction.

Without a framework, this can become complex and time-consuming.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
To solve this, the project uses Spring Boot as a foundation.  

- Implemented **controllers** to handle incoming requests.  
- Used **services and repositories** to manage business logic and database operations.  
- Integrated **JPA** for seamless data persistence.  
- Designed the flow so data can be created, read, updated, and deleted in a simple manner.  
- Added **Thymeleaf templates** for rendering views (where needed).  
- Configured **MySQL database** for real-world persistence.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
With this project:
- Users can interact with the application smoothly.  
- Data is stored and retrieved reliably from the database.  
- The architecture is clean, separating concerns between controller, service, and repository layers.  
- The project can be extended easily for new features in the future.  

---

## ðŸ“– Next Steps
- Add more business rules as needed.  
- Enhance UI using frontend frameworks if required.  
- Secure endpoints with authentication/authorization.
